# A simplified energy-balance model for ice melt below debris

These scripts and functions implement a simplified energy-balance model for simulating ice melt below debris at the surfaces of debris-covered glaciers. It solves the one-dimensional heat equation to conduct heat through the debris layer, following Reid and Brock (2010), where the boundary condition at the debris surface is a simplified debris-surface energy balance (cf. Oerlemans, 2001, for debris-free ice melt), which contains two free parameters to be calibrated, and where the boundary condition at the ice surface is the temperature of melting ice.
